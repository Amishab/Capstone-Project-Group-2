    "summary": "WASHINGTON \u00ad\u2013 On Wednesday, U.S.\nSenators John McCain (R-AZ), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and Bob Menendez (D-NJ), member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, led a bipartisan letter to President Trump today calling on the administration to urge Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to stop harassing American diplomats, to respect human rights, and to uphold democratic values in Turkey.\nCiting several recent actions including the arbitrary arrest of several U.S. Consulate employees in Istanbul, the detention of top Amnesty International officials, the sentencing by a Turkish court of Wall Street Journal reporter Ayla Albayrak, and the brutal attack by Turkish security personnel of peaceful demonstrators protesting Erdogan\u2019s visit to Washington, D.C., the senators urged President Trump to demand the Erdogan government respect human rights and the rule of law.\n\u201cErdogan and his allies have corroded Turkey\u2019s democracy by mounting an assault on the rule of law, using sweeping state of emergency authorities to stifle fundamental rights including free speech, undermining the independence of the judiciary, and quashing any expressions of opposition,\u201d wrote the senators.\nThe letter could be read here.",

    "summary": "While details of the House and Senate bills differ, many pass-through owners would owe more than 20 percent in taxes for much of their income.\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, used the savings to make his bill\u2019s personal tax reductions modestly more generous.\nAnother provision in the Senate plan would end the bill\u2019s personal income tax cuts in 2026.\nA small group of House Republicans largely from New York and New Jersey rebelled because the House plan would erase tax deductions for state and local income and sales taxes and limit property tax deductions to $10,000.\nThe House measure would reduce and ultimately repeal the tax paid on the largest inheritances, while the Senate would limit that levy to fewer estates.",
